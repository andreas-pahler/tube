# Comments

* I used TfL API because I couldn't easily find real-time data on Yahoo Finance
* TfL updates data every 50 seconds or so -- so need to wait for a minute to see changes


# Future improvements

* Put services, controllers etc. in separate files
* Use Angular directives instead of templating in main HTML file
* Better error handling/reporting in API client code
